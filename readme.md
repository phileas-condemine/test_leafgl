### Using LeafGL to display "APL" score per commune (FRA)

This repo is all about using leafgl.

You can find a running example [here on shinyapps.io](https://drees.shinyapps.io/test_leafgl/).

I was inspired by this [dashboard](https://github.com/139bercy/decp-monitoring) and this [repo](https://github.com/pbatey/flexdashboard-example) to deploy the map as a [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/using.html) on [Github pages HERE](https://phileas-condemine.github.io/test_leafgl/) !
